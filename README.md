# BlinkDetector
Code and data accompanying the paper Nystr√∂m, M., Andersson, R., Niehorster, D. C., Hessels, R. S., & Hooge, I. T. (2024). What is a blink? Classifying and characterizing blinks in eye openness signals. Behavior Research Methods, 1-20.

To test the blink algorithm, open and run the file `run_classification.py`.

Tested with Python 3.10.10, using Pandas (v. 1.5.3), Scipy (v. 1.10.0).

The version of the algorithm used in the papers is the following:

The `data`-folder contains two sub-folders: `spectrum` and `fusion`. The `spectrum` folder contains data from the article and are recorded with the Tobii Pro Spectum at 600 Hz (using firmware 2.6.1). The `fusion` folder contains sample data recorded with the Tobii Pro Fusion at 120 Hz (Fusion driver 2.5.4.0, Fusion firmware 96e7b52964, set up using Eye Tracker Manager 2.6.0, data collected using Pro Lab 1.217).
The fusion data are provided to exemplify the performance of the blink detection algorithm on data with lower sampling frequency.
